        <item>"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race."</item>
        <item>"The degree of personal freedom that exists in a society is determined more by the economic and technological structure of the society than by its laws or its form of government."</item>
        <item>"These engineered human beings may be happy in such a society, but they most certainly will not be free. They will have been reduced to the status of domestic animals."</item>
        <item>"It would be better to dump the whole stinking system and take the consequences."</item>
        <item>"Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them the drugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own society... Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect, antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual\'s internal state in such a way as to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable."</item>
        <item>"Never lose hope, be persistent and stubborn and never give up. There are many instances in history where apparent losers suddenly turn out to be winners unexpectedly, so you should never conclude all hope is lost."</item>
        <item>"The concept of \'mental health\' in our society is defined largely by the extent to which an individual behaves in accord with the needs of the system and does so without showing signs of stress."</item>
        <item>"It is important not to confuse freedom with mere permissiveness."</item>
        <item>"The big problem is that people don\'t believe a revolution is possible, and it is not possible precisely because they do not believe it is possible."</item>
        <item>"Our society tends to regard as a sickness any mode of thought or behavior that is inconvenient for the system and this is plausible because when an individual doesn\'t fit into the system it causes pain to the individual as well as problems for the system. Thus the manipulation of an individual to adjust him to the system is seen as a cure for a sickness and therefore as good."</item>
        <item>"Power depends ultimately on physical force. By teaching people that violence is wrong (except, of course, when the system itself uses violence via the police or the military), the system maintains its monopoly on physical force and thus keeps all power in its own hands."</item>
        <item>"But what first motivated me wasn\'t anything I read. I just got mad seeing the machines ripping up the woods."</item>
        <item>"There is nothing wrong with violence in itself. In any particular case, whether violence is good or bad depends on how it is used and the purpose for which it is used."</item>
        <item>"Those who are most sensitive about \'politically incorrect\' terminology are not the average black ghetto-dweller, Asian immigrant, abused woman or disabled person, but a minority of activists, many of whom do not even belong to any \'oppressed\' group but come from privileged strata of society."</item>
        <item>"The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser."</item>
        <item>"It is not possible to make a LASTING compromise between technology and freedom, because technology is by far the more powerful social force and continually encroaches on freedom through REPEATED compromises."</item>
        <item>"We can do anything we like as long as it is UNIMPORTANT."</item>
        <item>"To those who think that all this sounds like science fiction, we point out that yesterday\'s science fiction is today\'s fact. The Industrial Revolution has radically altered man\'s environment and way of life, and it is only to be expected that as technology is increasingly applied to the human body and mind, man himself will be altered as radically as his environment and way of life have been."</item>
        <item>"Constitutional rights are useful up to a point, but they do not serve to guarantee much more than what could be called the bourgeois conception of freedom. According to the bourgeois conception, a \'free\' man is essentially an element of a social machine and has only a certain set of prescribed and delimited freedoms; freedoms that are designed to serve the needs of the social machine more than those of the individual."</item>
        <item>"If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later."</item>
        <item>"The leftist is anti-individualistic... He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his own ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs."</item>
        <item>"Let\'s stick to the practical and the concrete: Would you like it if people lived in a virtual world? If machines were smarter than people? If, in the future, people, animals and plants were products of technology? If you don\'t like these ideas, then for you the computer and biological sciences clearly are dangerous."</item>
        <item>"Manifesto. Read my Manifesto. I\'ve written a Manifesto. It\'s all in the Manifesto!"</item>
        <item>"No, what worries me is that I might in a sense adapt to this environment and come to be comfortable here and not resent it anymore. And I am afraid that as the years go by that I may forget, I may begin to lose my memories of the mountains and the woods and that\'s what really worries me, that I might lose those memories, and lose that sense of contact with wild nature in general. But I am not afraid they are going to break my spirit."</item>
        <item>"We are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not."</item>
        <item>"It is obvious that [leftists] are not cool-headed logicians systematically analyzing the foundations of knowledge. They are deeply involved emotionally in their attack on truth and reality."</item>
        <item>"People do not consciously and rationally choose the form of their society. Societies develop through processes of social evolution that are not under rational human control."</item>
        <item>"I believe in nothing."</item>
